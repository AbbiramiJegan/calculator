# Simple JavaScript Calculator

## Overview

This project is a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage. 
Additional features include a delete function, an all-clear function, and some advanced mathematical operations like reciprocal, squaring, and square root.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`÷`), and percentage (`%`).
- **Advanced Operations**: Reciprocal (`1/x`), squaring (`x²`), and square root (`√x`).
- **Clear Functionality**: The `AC` button clears all inputs and resets the calculator state.
- **Delete Functionality**: The `DEL` button deletes the last character entered in the current operand.
- **Responsive Design**: The calculator is designed to be responsive and user-friendly on various devices.

## Structure

- **HTML (`index.html`)**: Provides the structure of the calculator, including the buttons and display areas.
- **CSS (`styles.css`)**: Styles the calculator, giving it a modern look with a gradient background and intuitive button design.
- **JavaScript (`script.js`)**: Implements the calculator's logic, handling user input, and updating the display.

## How to Use

1. **Numbers and Operations**: Click on the number buttons to enter digits. Use the operation buttons to select the desired arithmetic operation.
2. **Compute**: After entering the numbers and selecting an operation, click the `=` button to compute the result.
3. **Advanced Operations**: Use the `1/x`, `x²`, and `√x` buttons to perform advanced mathematical functions on the current operand.
4. **Clear and Delete**: Use the `AC` button to clear all inputs and reset the calculator. The `DEL` button removes the last digit or character entered.
